# Mark Smin

Mark Smin is a 3D arcade shooter that features the fictional character, Mark, shooting down enemies who are trying to push him off of a cliff into an endless fall or simply knock him out. The game would start on a spacious platform where enemies would spawn to achieve their goal, and mark would have to defend himself from them by shooting them. The platform would gradually decrease in size, making less room for Mark to maneuver. The more enemies Mark eliminates, the higher the score goes.  

I would like to implement three modes into the game. The first mode would be classic, where the player would simply be provided with a time counter and enemy-kill counter, and if the player falls off the edge or takes three hits, a finished screen appears. The second mode would give the player three minutes to kill as many enemies as possible. The third mode would be just like the classic, except if the player gets hit once, then it's game over. 

The enemies would vary, with one enemy needing one hit to die, and another kind needing two hits.
